## Goals ध्येयानि
Dyugangā is a work group dedicated to the promotion of ever-victorious Hindu ideals and arts. It's current focus is in presenting important texts for easy study.

The texts may be presented as audio files (eg: [MahAbhArata audio book project](../../projects/audio/mbh-audio/)), as web pages (eg: [Vishvas's mantra notes](https://vvasuki.github.io/saMskAra/mantra/agni/paravastu-saama/mahAvaishvAnara-vratam/), [EkAgnikANDa commentary on wikisource](https://sa.wikisource.org/s/1vnh)), as dictionaries (eg: [stardict](https://sanskrit-coders.github.io/dictionaries/offline/)).

The choice of material is heavily depends on the special interests of its current director (vedas, kalpa, purANa-s).

## Establishment संस्थापनम्
The group is hosted under the aegis of shrI manjunath's [Cleverkare](http://cleverkare.com), an entirely unrelated business.
